R interface to [rlite](https://github.com/seppo0010/rlite).  rlite is a "self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional redis-compatible database engine. rlite is to Redis what SQLite is to SQL.

This package is designed to be used as a driver for [`RedisAPI`](https://github.com/ropensci/RedisAPI), providing only the glue code to make this work.

# Usage

See [`RedisAPI`](https://github.com/ropensci/RedisAPI) for more details.  The main function here is `rrlite::hirlite` that creates a `redis_api` object that exposes the full Redis API, or for use with `RedisAPI::rdb`.  Some low level `rlite` support is available with `rrlite::rlite_context`.

## High level (rdb)

```{r}
r <- RedisAPI::rdb(rrlite::hirlite)
r$set("foo", runif(20))
r$get("foo")
r$keys()
```

## Redis level

Provides a reasonably complete interface to raw redis commands:

```{r}
db <- rrlite::hirlite(":memory:")
db$SET("foo", "bar")
db$GET("foo")
db$KEYS("*")
```

## Low level

```{r}
con <- rrlite::rlite_context(":memory:")
con$run(c("set", "foo", "bar"))
```

All commands supported by `rlite`, with no error checking.

Asynchronous support via

```
con$write(c("set", "foo", "bar"))
con$read()
```

# Approach

This package aims to be a drop-in self-contained replacement for `redux` without requiring  `Redis` server.  So as much of the package as possible is automaticaly generated from `redux` as possible.  The only installed files not generated are:

* R/hirlite.R
* src/subscribe.c
