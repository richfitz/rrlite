R interface to [rlite](https://github.com/seppo0010/rlite).  rlite is a "self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional redis-compatible database engine. rlite is to Redis what SQLite is to SQL.

This package is designed to be used as a driver for [`RedisAPI`](https://github.com/ropensci/RedisAPI), providing only the glue code to make this work.

# Usage

See [`RedisAPI`](https://github.com/ropensci/RedisAPI) for more details.  The main function here is `rrlite::hirlite` that creates a `redis_api` object that exposes the full Redis API, or for use with `RedisAPI::rdb`.  Some low level `rlite` support is available with `rrlite::rlite_context`.

## High level (rdb)

```{r}
r <- RedisAPI::rdb(rrlite::hirlite)
r$set("foo", runif(20))
r$get("foo")
r$keys()
```

## Redis level

Provides a reasonably complete interface to raw redis commands:

```{r}
db <- rrlite::hirlite(":memory:")
db$SET("foo", "bar")
db$GET("foo")
db$KEYS("*")
```

## Low level

```{r}
con <- rrlite::rlite_context(":memory:")
con$run(c("set", "foo", "bar"))
```

All commands supported by `rlite`, with no error checking.

Asynchronous support via

```
con$write(c("set", "foo", "bar"))
con$read()
```

# Installation

Because the source currently contains a submodule, the usual approach with `devtools::install_github` does not work, but this does:

```
devtools::install_github("ropensci/RedisAPI")
devtools::install_git("https://github.com/ropensci/rrlite", args="--recursive")
```

If installing manually, either clone the repository with the argument `--recursive` or after cloning the repository for the first time, run:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
