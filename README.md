R interface to rlite https://github.com/seppo0010/rlite

To install, after cloning the repo the first time, run (from the command line)

```
./bootstrap.sh
```

which will clone the current version of rlite.  There are no releases to point at yet, so this is going to be a moving target for a while.  I'll modify the script to keep to current soon.  See [this related issue](https://github.com/richfitz/rrlite/issues/1) for jqr.
